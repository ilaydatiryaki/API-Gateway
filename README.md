####  What Can Be Done with API Gateway?

Since the access to the services that undertake the functional responsibility piecemeal will be indirectly through the API gateway, identity and authorization verification operations can only be configured on the API gateway.

#### Logging

Detailed logging can be made about the requests made to the services, so that which service, by whom, how intensely it functions, etc. such as statistical information.

#### Response Caching

It can cache the outputs produced as a result of the requests coming to the services through the API gateway, thus reducing the service costs.

#### Routing

The addresses of the services can be encapsulated differently and the clients can be directed to the relevant main routes through this capsule.
